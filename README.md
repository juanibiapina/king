# King

King is a prototype text editor. I built it in order to understand the basic problems involved with writing a text editor.

As an outcome of this prototype, I have come up with a rough plan on what features I would like to have first and what are the main problems that I need to solve.

Possible next steps:

- Separate view code from editor logic
- Full UTF-8 support

Non-goals:

- Windows support
- Non terminal GUI
