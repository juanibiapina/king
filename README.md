# King

King is a text editor project. The first milestone has been reached, where a prototype editor was built.

The outcome of the prototype is a rough plan on what features are needed for a basic editor and what are the main problems that need to be solved.

The next milestone is making the editor stable (no crashes or bugs) and with basic editing functionality. This should be the first 1.0 release.

# Non-goals
